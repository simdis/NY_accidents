# NY_accidents
Some examples of using both python and Hadoop to find out some properties, defined by a university's project.

The python examples are developed using the pandas library (http://pandas.pydata.org), whereas the corresponding Hadoop scripts are developed as a Map-Reduce job.

The retrieved information are:
1) The number of weekly lethal accidents.
2) The number of accidents per contributing factor (only the one of the first vehicle in the dataset) and for each of them the percentage of deaths.
3a) The number of weekly accidents per borough.
3b) The average weekly accidents per borough

NOTE: The dataset is not available into this repository. Actually, it can be downloaded at https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Public-Safety/NYPD-Motor-Vehicle-Collisions/h9gi-nx95
